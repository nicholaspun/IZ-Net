\subsection{Method}

We explain our methodology for creating a network that will recognize our members:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \bf{Creation}: We create NN1 \cite[Table 1]{facenet}, NN2 \cite[Table 2]{facenet}, Keras InceptionNetV3
    \item \bf{Training}: We experiment over two different training techniques: Using the triplet loss function and treating the problem as a binary classification problem \cite{deepface}
    \item \bf{Analysis}: We use a suite of visualizations for analyzing our various trained networks: t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, boxplot and a table of medoid distances. 
\end{enumerate}

\cite{tsne_how_to} was quite informative for tweaking the hyperparameters of the TSNE algorithm \inlinecode{python}
